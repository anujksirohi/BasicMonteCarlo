# BasicMonteCarlo
Monte Carlo Methods are widely used in Machine Learning, Physical Sciences and Engineering applications. In this repository, I have included few basic Monte Carlo algorithms. 

This repository contains python code for:
1. Box-muller method to generate Gaussian distributed random numbers.
2. Hit and Miss 
3. Estimation of pi
